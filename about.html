    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      At DataThrive, we believe health data should work for everyone—not just big institutions. That’s why we empower everyday people to take part in health research by sharing insights from the devices they already wear, like fitness trackers and smartwatches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspired by our founder Elijah Grant’s personal experience, our mission is to turn passive data into active progress. We make it simple and secure for users to participate in cutting-edge studies—right from the comfort of their homes. Whether you're walking, sleeping, or tracking your heart rate, you’re not just collecting numbers—you’re fueling innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And because we believe your contributions matter, we reward you for them. With DataThrive, you're not just getting points—you're driving discoveries, accelerating treatments, and making healthcare smarter for everyone.

      <h3>Elijah Grant – CEO & Founder</h3>
      <p>
        Elijah founded DataThrive after a life-changing moment: watching a loved one struggle through a chronic illness with limited support, delayed information, and disconnected care. He realized the power of everyday health data—like steps taken, heart rate, and sleep—was being underutilized. What if those metrics could empower people, connect them to research, and drive better outcomes?
      </p>
      <p>
        That spark became a mission: to help everyday people thrive by making it easy, rewarding, and meaningful to share their data. Elijah believes that when people are active participants in research, we don't just advance science—we build healthier futures for everyone.
