      <h3>Elijah Grant – CEO & Founder</h3>
      <p>
        Elijah founded DataThrive after a life-changing moment: watching a loved one struggle through a chronic illness with limited support, delayed information, and disconnected care. He realized the power of everyday health data—like steps taken, heart rate, and sleep—was being underutilized. What if those metrics could empower people, connect them to research, and drive better outcomes?
      </p>
      <p>
        That spark became a mission: to help everyday people thrive by making it easy, rewarding, and meaningful to share their data. Elijah believes that when people are active participants in research, we don't just advance science—we build healthier futures for everyone.
