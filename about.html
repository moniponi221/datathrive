    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      At DataThrive, we believe health data should work for everyone—not just big institutions. That’s why we empower everyday people to take part in health research by sharing insights from the devices they already wear, like fitness trackers and smartwatches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspired by our founder Elijah Grant’s personal experience, our mission is to turn passive data into active progress. We make it simple and secure for users to participate in cutting-edge studies—right from the comfort of their homes. Whether you're walking, sleeping, or tracking your heart rate, you’re not just collecting numbers—you’re fueling innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And because we believe your contributions matter, we reward you for them. With DataThrive, you're not just getting points—you're driving discoveries, accelerating treatments, and making healthcare smarter for everyone.
